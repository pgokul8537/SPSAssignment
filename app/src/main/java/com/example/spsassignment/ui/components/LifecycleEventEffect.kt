 *
 * This function should **not** be used to listen for [Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY] because
 * Compose stops recomposing after receiving a [Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP] and will never be
 * aware of an ON_DESTROY to launch [onEvent].
 *
 * This function should also **not** be used to launch tasks in response to callback
 * events by way of storing callback data as a [Lifecycle.State] in a [MutableState].
 * Instead, see [currentStateAsState] to obtain a [State<Lifecycle.State>][State]
 * that may be used to launch jobs in response to state changes.
 *
 * @param event The [Lifecycle.Event] to listen for
 * @param lifecycleOwner The lifecycle owner to attach an observer
